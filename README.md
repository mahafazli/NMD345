# NMD345.github.io

This is a final project that I have made for my new media class NMD345: web applications. I have used HTML,CSS and a little bit of JS (javascript) to make this website. This website is a personal portifolio that I have made to share the work I have made during my 4 years of college as a Computer Science major and a new media minor. The website is currently in the works so it is not complete.

Enjoy ! :)
